# Project Placement

We value being able to work on projects that are fulfilling and in line with the technologies we enjoy or are interested in learning. One of the advantages to our transparent internal system is that every member our team is aware of all of the work that is available and in the pipeline. This allows team members to actively add themselves to projects they'd like to work on via discussion in the Weekly Meeting or through 1:1 meetings (or both). Those meetings are also excellent opportunities to determine if we can better align people with available work based on their interests.

In an effort to avoid burnout, team members are encouraged to shift projects if they need a new challenge or feel fatigued.
